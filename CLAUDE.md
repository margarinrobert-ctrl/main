# Working notes for this repository

Quantitative futures research on NQ/MNQ. One instrument, OHLCV 1-minute bars,
2022-12-26 → 2025-12-12. Read `docs/RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md` before proposing or judging a strategy.

## The rules that keep getting re-learned the hard way

**Select on research, read the locked block once.** The split is the first 65% of sessions.
Any criterion that touches the locked block — profitability, excess, correlation — puts the
holdout inside the selection. This has happened twice here and both times the result looked
better than it was.

**A win rate means nothing without its base rate.** The driftless bound is 1/(1+R), but the *real*
base rate is not that: costs push it down, a wider barrier pushes it back up, and drift lifts longs
and sinks shorts. On 60-minute bars a long 2.5×ATR 1R strategy wins **54.2%** by default. Score
every rule against its own geometry's base, computed from the population.

**Direction is not free on this sample.** NQ rose 89%. Any search allowed to pick a side picks
long. See §4c.

**Ban calendar conditions from rule search.** Weekday and month conditions partition the sample
five or twelve ways and hand the search a free lottery. Removing them was worth $8,771 on the
holdout; requiring subset coherence was worth another $6,030. Ranking by a *minimum* over a
neighbourhood, the obvious over-correction, cost $18,970. See `docs/ib/STUDY_1R_PROCEDURE.md`.

**Test a condition against a random filter of the same selectivity**, not against total dollars
(which fails every restrictive condition) and not against per-trade edge (which passes every one).
`research/dropone.py`. The research p-value is decoration; read the locked one.

**Sizing creates no edge.** Fixed one contract per leg, AVA across legs. See §9.

## Tooling

| module | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `research/test_suite.py` | 57-test battery on one strategy |
| `research/quant_brain.py` | features, regimes, metrics, improvement engine, portfolio |
| `research/alpha_factory2.py` | 16.2M strategy generator, 115 conditions |
| `research/vol_sizing.py` | the eight named volatility-sizing methods |
| `research/intrabar.py` | true 1-minute path execution modelling |
| `research/pine_export.py` | Pine strategy + indicator emitters |
| `research/pine_lint.py` | **run before shipping any Pine** — there is no compiler here |

## Pine

Three definitional traps, all of which have shipped broken once: ATR is `ta.ema(ta.tr(true), 14)`
not `ta.atr`; bare `hour`/`minute` are **exchange** time (Chicago for CME) not New York; CCI is on
`hlc3`. Entries require `barstate.isconfirmed` so the Strategy Tester's "Script execution"
checkboxes cannot change the result — without it, tick evaluation fires 5.1× as many signals with
80% on bars that never satisfied the rule.
