# Working notes for this repository

Quantitative futures research on NQ/MNQ. One instrument, OHLCV 1-minute bars,
2022-12-26 → 2025-12-12. Read `docs/RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md` before proposing or judging a strategy.

## The rules that keep getting re-learned the hard way

**Select on research, read the locked block once.** The split is the first 65% of sessions.
Any criterion that touches the locked block — profitability, excess, correlation — puts the
holdout inside the selection. This has happened twice here and both times the result looked
better than it was.

**A win rate means nothing without its base rate.** The driftless bound is 1/(1+R), but the *real*
base rate is not that: costs push it down, a wider barrier pushes it back up, and drift lifts longs
and sinks shorts. On 60-minute bars a long 2.5×ATR 1R strategy wins **54.2%** by default. Score
every rule against its own geometry's base, computed from the population.

**Direction is not free on this sample.** NQ rose 89%. Any search allowed to pick a side picks
long. See §4c.

**Ban calendar conditions from rule search.** Weekday and month conditions partition the sample
five or twelve ways and hand the search a free lottery. Removing them was worth $8,771 on the
holdout; requiring subset coherence was worth another $6,030. Ranking by a *minimum* over a
neighbourhood, the obvious over-correction, cost $18,970. See `docs/ib/STUDY_1R_PROCEDURE.md`.

**Test a condition against a random filter of the same selectivity**, not against total dollars
(which fails every restrictive condition) and not against per-trade edge (which passes every one).
`research/dropone.py`. The research p-value is decoration; read the locked one.

**Sizing creates no edge.** Fixed one contract per leg, AVA across legs. See §9.

**A win rate that exists at only one threshold is not a mechanism.** Parameterise every shipped
rule and sweep its own neighbourhood on research; a real edge decays smoothly. V1's 70.9% falls to
its base rate two rungs away, while V3 *gained* holdout significance when loosened (matched-control
p 0.384 → 0.040) because it finally had enough trades. Corollary, learned the hard way: over a
monotone threshold grid a union **is its loosest member**, so gate on the SIZE of the excess, never
its sign. See `docs/ib/STUDY_1R_MORE.md`.

**`ent_bar` is the FILL bar, not the signal bar.** Read any condition, feature, regime label or
ATR at `ent_bar` and you are reading a bar that closes after the order is sent — for a rule whose
median hold is 0 bars, the bar the trade resolves on. Use `test_suite.sig_bar`. This produced a
holdout result at p 0.0005 that replicated across 9 of 9 independently-found strategies, and was
pure leakage; it also faked V2's "edge lives below the 200 EMA". A conditional split of realised
trades is not a filter test — filter the TRIGGERS and re-simulate. See `docs/ib/STUDY_AUCTION.md`.

**Volume profile adds nothing here.** 47 auction conditions (POC, value area, VAH/VAL as levels,
opening classification, naked edges, LVN/HVN) x 9 strategies: 7 of 172 tests passed on research
(fewer than chance), 0 survived the holdout. Low-volume nodes are revisited at exactly the rate of
a distance-matched random level, 42.8% against 42.8%. The 80% rule measures **50.6%**, worse than a
time-matched control's 59.9%. Do not re-run this.

**A decorrelated leg still has to have an edge.** Adding a coin-flip signal at |rho| 0.25 raised
the book's net profit, cut its Sharpe 3.73 -> 3.23 and more than doubled its drawdown. A
correlation matrix alone will talk you into that trade. See `docs/ib/STUDY_SEMIVARIANCE.md`.

**Normalise a signal before deciding it is dead.** SAM looked null over 4,032 combinations
because only the paper's reading was tried. Adding a scale-free ratio, a trailing z-score and the
CROSS as well as the state -- 1,440 conditions, 142.8M combinations -- produced four scalps that
beat a matched control on the holdout and lift book Sharpe 3.73 -> 4.57. On 5-minute bars the edge
is specifically in the INTRABAR estimator: the best bar-return-only 5m rule fails the matched
control at p 0.354, and TradingView cannot supply intrabar data at that scale. See
`docs/ib/STUDY_SAM_SCALP.md`.

**Score against a matched control, not a population mean.** Random entries with the same side,
geometry and minute-of-day distribution price in drift, costs, barrier width and session timing at
once. `research/oner_anom.py`. And split net P&L by exit reason first: a 1R rule earning at the
TIME stop is a direction bet, not a barrier edge.

## Pine

Three definitional traps, all of which have shipped broken once: ATR is `ta.ema(ta.tr(true), 14)`
not `ta.atr`; bare `hour`/`minute` are **exchange** time (Chicago for CME) not New York; CCI is on
`hlc3`. Entries require `barstate.isconfirmed` so the Strategy Tester's "Script execution"
checkboxes cannot change the result — without it, tick evaluation fires 5.1× as many signals with
80% on bars that never satisfied the rule.
